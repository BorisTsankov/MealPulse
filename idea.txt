Look at my codebase and make the homepage look amazing.
Make it dark theme and work with blue
and purple (emphasis on the purple) to make it look proffesional. If needed
you can change the html structure provided it is neccessary
(changing/adding IDs to elements, general improvement of an exisiting
element), I like to have the overall view and feel as my current version.
Add animations but don't go overboard making the keyframes.
Please do not use generic emojis for icons, if you find a good place for them,
use online svgs and replace all emojis you see in my existing codebase with the svgs.
Before you start, I really want you to look at the codebase and make smart decisions
in terms of html edits so we keep our Views clean and readable.
